<hr><b>NEWSFLASH</b><hr>
<p>
Alert - take care at Christmas parties chaps.
<p>
Police are warning all men who frequent clubs, partygoers and unsuspecting pub regulars to be alert
and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman.
<p>
A date r@pe drug on the market called "beer" is used by many females to target unsuspecting men. The
drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans,
from taps and in large "kegs."
<p>
"Beer" is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go
home and have sex with them. Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units
of "beer" and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex. Men are rendered helpless against
this approach.
<p>
After several "beers" men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women
to whom they would never normally be attracted. After drinking "beer" men often awaken with only hazy
memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that
something bad occurred.
<p>
At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings in a familiar scam known
as "a relationship." It has been reported that in extreme cases, the female may even be shrewd enough
to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer term form of servitude and punishment referred to as
"marriage." Apparently, men are much more susceptible to this scam after "beer" is administered and sex
is offered by the predatory female.

<p>
Please! Alert your male friends to this new scam. However, if you fall victim to this insidious "beer"
and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town
where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly
affected, like-minded guys.
<p>
For the support group nearest you, just look up "Golf Courses" in the yellow pages.
