Turkey 2011

   <p>        
   On the 30/04/2011 Ali and I headed to Turkey for our wedding. We planned for a weeklong holiday with our 20 guests, followed by a one week honeymoon 
   for Ali and I. Both weeks were fantastic and with so much to say and write about, we thought we would let the photos speak for themselves.

   After a late arrival in Cirali the previous evening, myself and some of the guests went Scuba Diving out of Kemer Marina. The diving was organised
   by the hotel and was absolutely fantastic. Dee, Tony, Lesley and Lucy did a "try dive" whilst I got to finally dive the Paris II Wreck.

Itinerary
</b>
<hr>
   We planned for a weeklong holiday with our guests with the wedding to take place towards the end of the week. As part of the holiday we organised some
   excursions of to local sites, into the next major town, walking, shopping etc. We were quite insistent that guests who wanted to spend the week doing their own 
   thing, do so, if they wanted to sunbathe for a week then so be it. It is after all their holiday too!. The only thing we did insist upon was that they actually
   turned up for the ceremony!
   <p>
   The week with the guests begun with flying out of London Gatwick airport on the 30/04/2011, staying for one week and returning on the 07/05/2011. Ali and I would
   stay on another week for the honeymoon.

I recently completed my PADI Open Water Diver course, and was kindly presented with these cartoons in my local pub. For those who
don't know the pub or the area, the pub is on the quay, the gazebo type thing in the cartoons is an outside smoking area.

<p>
I do enjoy the odd pint...<br>

Sometimes more than one...<br>
