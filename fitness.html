Ali and I started a new fitness regime (it was a new years resolution I'm afraid!). I've been getting some really incredulous
looks from people when I tell them so I thought I'd offer you this small photo diary as irefutable proof...
<p>
We like to start with a small bite to eat, maybe washed down with a small beer...<br>

<p>
Some foods take more washing down than others...<br>

All that washing down can be hungry work so a quick top up...<br>

We will then head to the local jogging circuit. Note the carefully controlled fluid intake and Guenter joining us for some "Health Drink"...<br>

(the site of) all that jogging often makes us thirsty. Word has got out about our healthy lifestyle and Kevin has also joined us<br>

As athletes in our chosen field, we will reward ourselves for a strenuous day well done...<br>
