a swear word. He later attempted to better this feat on BBC TV's Record Breakers programme by dropping a car battery
on his foot. It ended in failure when he repeated the word b@stard after 12mins 58secs.

<b>Beer Drinking</b><br>
The greatest amount of beer drunk before going to the lavatory was 25.5 litres (45 pints) of assorted weak lagers,

doorway of a newsagents shop in Knutsford high street on 22nd December 1986. Mr Wingfield was arrested and charged
with a public order offence 17 mins into his record attempt, but arresting officers had to wait a further 19mins 24sec
before taking him back to the station for a kicking.
<p>

<b>Hottest Curry Eaten</b><br>
Many claims are made about the ferocity of curries eaten, but in the main they are difficult to substantiate. The
hottest verifiable curry eaten was a XXXHot Chicken Murg Thaal with extra chillies consumed by George Wingfield (GB)
at the Bengal Tiger Restaurant, Knutsford on 23rd December 1986. The curry was reportedly so hot that between kitchen
and table it burst into flames, singeing the waiters eyebrows.

<b>Biggest Fart</b><br>
The largest and most catastrophic fart was one dropped by Mr. George Wingfield (GB) in the car park of the Dog and
Duck, Knutsford, on the morning of the 24th December 1986. Suffering from terrible guts Mr. Wingfield gingerly attempted
to squeeze one out whilst bending to pick up his car keys, but the resulting flatulant explosion blew his entire
digestive tract out of his arse. Attending firemen hosed down his smoking guts for two hours before paramedics
with breathing aparatus could begin the process of pushing them back up.

Wayne Fletcher (GB) in his Mark II Escort. When traffic lights in Stockport, Cheshire turned green Fletcher attempted
to pull off at such speed that his front wheels spun for an amazing 42 secs before the car began to move. Both tyres
