Rants

<p>
I can rant with the best of them (and usually do!), if you've been referred here by an email of mine it is most likely
because you forwarded me a virus warning email. Don't take personally what I've written, you are not the first and will
without doubt not be the last.
<p>
Rants in reverse, anatomical, chronological order by flavour (just like on Amazon).

<p>
I was going to include my Ex-Wife on here but legal advice (and fear for my personal safety) prompted me
to take the soft route and pretend she doesn't exist (I've been doing it for years).
<p>
If you have a pet hate or rant you'd like included, or feel I should add something - your best bet is probably to email the European
Commision. They have laws about this sort of thing and will probably make me add it to this page:-)
<p>
If you don't like what you are reading on here, I'm sorry but you're probably on the wrong site. You could try

 - I'm always open to discussion, but please don't send the sort of vitriol I've been getting about my
