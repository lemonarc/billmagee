<hr><b>HELPDESK</b><hr>
<p>
Allegedly true story, recording of a *********** helpdesk conversation.....
<p>

Needless to say the HelpDesk employee was fired however, he/she is currently suing the ************** organization
for "Termination without Cause".
<p>

"***** **** computer assistance; may I help you?"<br>
"Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."<br>
"What sort of trouble?"<br>
"Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away."<br>
"Went away?"<br>
"They disappeared."<br>
"Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?"<br>
"Nothing."<br>
"Nothing?"<br>
"It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."<br>
"Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"<br>
"How do I tell?"<br>
"Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?"<br>
"What's a sea-prompt?"<br>
"Never mind, can you move your cursor around the screen?"<br>
"There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type."<br>
"Does your monitor have a power indicator?"<br>
"What's a monitor?"<br>
"It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?"<br>
"I don't know."<br>
"Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?"<br>
"Yes, I think so."<br>
"Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall."<br>
"Yes, it is."<br>
"When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?"<br>
"No."<br>
"Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable."<br>
"Okay, here it is."<br>
"Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer."<br>
"I can't reach."<br>
"Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?"<br>
"No."<br>
"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br>
"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark."<br>
"Dark?"<br>
"Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window."<br>
"Well, turn on the office light then."<br>
"I can't."<br>
"No? Why not?"<br>
"Because there's a power failure."<br>
"A power ... A power failure? Aha, Okay, we've got it licked now."<br>
"Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?"<br>
"Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."<br>
"Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."<br>
"Really? Is it that bad?"<br>
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."<br>
"Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"<br>
"Tell them you're too f***ing stupid to own a computer."<p>
