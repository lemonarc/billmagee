I was going to thank my Mum but she can't spell Oracle. I couldn't really tell you where the
content for this document came from. I've always had an unhealthy fascination with performance
and generally it's been from trial and error, making my own mistakes but most importantly listening and
reading.
<p>
There are many useful sites and forums on the web where a developer might meet a DBA,
a data warehouse developer dealing with terrabytes of data might meet another developer building
a home video library as hist first Oracle project.
<p>
I really cannot begin to highlight the benefit of being around these chaps while they discuss or
argue about their performance problems. He who sits and listens gets stiff knees, but he also learns alot.
<p>
As well as gleaning information from the people around you, have a quick check back to the Oracle
Documentation every now and then. A good developer and friend of mine recently mentioned that
he is often confused by extents and segments. It's not really a developers area but a quick look in
the 8.1.7 docs reveals one paragraph which explains the concept without getting too detailed.
<p>
Next time you have that feeling, get the docs and take a moment to look. Anyway, enough of that for
now, I'm off to read about the extensible optimiser and global hints:-)

Thanks to Tony Andrews for his technical and readability suggestions.
<ul>
   <li>Inclusion of histograms for the optimiser</li>
   <li>Clarification of acceptability of full table scans</li>
</ul>
