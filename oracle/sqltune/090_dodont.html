<p><FONT SIZE=3><b>DO</b></FONT><p>
   <ul>
   <li>DO use bind variables wherever possible (including in cursors)</li>
   <li>DO check your statements before releasing them, even if you don't want to tune your
       statements as you develop them.</li>
   <li>DO take any advice you can from the DBA's. Most are experts in their field and want to help</li>
   <li>DO co-operate with other developers regarding inefficient queries, or tables designs.
       50 other developers might also be fed up of performance on a certain table. If you are
       all having the same difficulty it might be time to get together and consider options</li>
   <li>DO consider this document as only a starting point, it is very abstract in places</li>
   <li>DO let me know of any other things you think should be added,corrected or clarified in
       this document</li>
   </ul>


<p><FONT SIZE=3><b>DO NOT</b></FONT><p>
   <ul>
   <li>DO NOT assume performance to be someone elses problem. It is everyones problem</li>
   <li>DO NOT listen to a word the DBA's say. They're all evil</li>
   <li>DO NOT assume that what works well today will work well tomorrow.</li>
   <li>DO NOT believe everything you are told, there are many, many myths out there,
       take a quick look in the Oracle Docs when you get a chance</li>
   </ul>
