<hr><b>EVOLUTION</b><hr>
<p>
Some examples of why the human race has probably evolved as far as possible. These are actual instruction labels on
consumer goods.
<p>

On Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping.<br>
(Gee, that's the only time I have to work on my hair!)<p>

On a bag of Fritos: You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details inside.<br>
(The shoplifter special!)<p>

On a bar of Dial soap: Directions: Use like regular soap.<br>
(and that would be how?)<p>

On some Swann frozen dinners: Serving suggestion: Defrost.<br>
(But it's 'just' a suggestion!)<p>

On a hotel-provided shower cap in a box: Fits one head.<br>
(which one?)<p>

On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom of box): Do not turn upside down.<br>
(Too late! You lose!)<p>

On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding: Product will be hot after heating.<br>
(Are you sure??? Let's experiment.)<p>

On packaging for a Rowenta iron: Do not iron clothes on body.<br>
(But wouldn't that save more time?) (Whose body?)<p>

On Boot's Children's cough medicine: Do not drive car or operate machinery.<br>
(We could do a lot to reduce the construction accidents if we just kept
those 5 year olds off those fork lifts.)<p>

On Nytol sleep aid: Warning: may cause drowsiness.<br>
(One would hope!)<p>

On a Korean kitchen knife: Warning: Keep out of Children.<br>
(or pets! What's for dinner?)<p>

On a string of Chinese-made Christmas lights: For indoor or outdoor use only.<br>
(As opposed to use in outer space.)<p>

On a Japanese food processor: Not to be used for the other use.<br>
(Now I'm curious.)<p>

On a Sunbeam Toaster: Do not use while bathing.<br>
(Makes for soggy toast.)<p>

On Sainsbury's peanuts: Warning: contains nuts.<br>
(But no peas?)<p>

On an American Airlines packet of nuts: Instructions: open packet, eat nuts.<br>
(Have lobotomy)<p>

On Costco's Kirkland brand Baby Wipes" Gentle enough for hands and face.<br>
(Should be! think why you bought it)<p>

On a matchbook cover where the sandpaper strip is on the back: For safety, strike on back.<br>
(And my other choice is?)<p>

On a Swedish chainsaw: Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals.<br>
(And while we're on this, your neck is not good at this, either...)<p>

On a Tot Tutors plastic "3 in 1" toy top table with chairs with photo of
table being used by two children: "Building blocks and child are not included"<br>
(Ask any parent, it always costs more with kids)<p>

On a child's Superman costume: Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly.<br>
(That's right, destroy a universal childhood belief)<p>
