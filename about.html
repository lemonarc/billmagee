Bill Magee
</b>
was born on his birthday to his mum and dad and continues to defy
<a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/" title="Some interesting contenders for Darwin">Darwin's</a>
theory of evolution by consistently
producing websites much worse than his last one.
<p>
In between
<b>
Working
</b>
throughout Europe developing
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/" title="Want to read about Oracle?">Oracle</a>
and

solutions he also
produces top quality special interest movies under the
<b>Mad Englishman

Bill is also a budding blues guitarist of local fame, mostly famed for the fact that no-one ever hangs around
long enough to hear him play. Would you? You'll often see him trawling the local bars begging people to listen to him,
without success. Much like trying to get people to sign his guestbook.
